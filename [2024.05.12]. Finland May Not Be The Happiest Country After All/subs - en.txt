Finland has been ranked as the happiest country again for the seventh year, followed by other Nordic countries. But are they really the happiest countries? What if we are measuring happiness the wrong way?
You've probably heard of the World Happiness Report. Well, it turns out there's some controversy brewing around how we measure happiness.
Every year the scientists at Gallup World Poll measure happiness around the world. They collect data on individual’s life evaluations using the Cantril ladder method. This method involves asking respondents to rate their current lives on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 representing the best possible life and 0 representing the worst. 
According to the World Happiness Report the difference in levels of happiness across countries boil down to six key factors: 
The average amount of money generated per person in a country (GDP per capita), 
The extent to which individuals have supportive social networks, such as friends, family, and community who they can rely on when in need (social support)
The quality of healthcare and overall well-being (healthy life expectancy)
Freedom to make life choices is of course an indispensable predictor of happiness (freedom),
Willingness of individuals to help others (generosity),
And last but not least the absence of corruption.
Sounds legit, right? But guess what? A study led by Lund University in Sweden challenges the method. They suggest that the method might be a bit biased.
Imagine this: You’re asked to rate your happiness on a scale from 0 to 10. Sounds simple. But what if the way the question is phrased makes you think more about money and status than about the things that truly bring you joy? That’s the dilemma this study highlights. 
And here’s where it gets really interesting. When the researchers changed the question to focus on concepts like harmony instead of wealth and power, guess what happened? People gave different answers. This suggests that the current method might not be capturing the full picture of happiness and well-being.
Another previous research has shown that despite Nordic countries being consistently ranked as the happiest in the world, people in parts of southern Europe actually report higher levels of mental well-being. Research indicates that while money can boost life satisfaction, it doesn't necessarily guarantee good mental health. Emotional well-being hits its peak at a certain income level, and beyond that, more money doesn't really make us happier.
So, what's the takeaway? Happiness is a complex beast. It's not just about the size of your bank account or your place on the social ladder. It's about feeling fulfilled, connected, and at peace with yourself and the world around you.
